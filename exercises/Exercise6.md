# Exercise 6 - Ownership and Heap Allocation in Rust

With a partner, please work through the "Learning Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists" (http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/too-many-lists/book/)

You should get at least to Section 2.8, "The Final Code".  If you have gotten this far, you will have learned more about ownership, testing, using multiple files in a Rust project, Option types, and Boxes.  You may continue onwards if you would like to know more about Rust, but it is not necessary.
